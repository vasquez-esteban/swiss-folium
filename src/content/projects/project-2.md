## Project Overview

Bog Urban Hotel is an executive hotel in Bogotá that needed a rework on their main website. Based on a Figma design created by my sister Karina Vásquez (a talented designer and content creator), I was responsible for developing the website, including SEO optimization, form implementation, and responsive design.

## Key Responsibilities

- Translated Figma designs into a fully functional website
- Implemented English and Spanish versions through routing
- Implemented responsive design for optimal viewing across devices
- Integrated and optimized web forms
- Conducted SEO optimization to improve site visibility

## Learning Experience

This project offered valuable experience working on a hotel website using Webflow, showcasing its strengths for design-focused projects. It highlighted the importance of selecting the right platform to balance aesthetics and functionality, particularly in industries where visual appeal plays a crucial role.

## Conclusion

The Bog Urban Hotel website project demonstrates my ability to transform design visions into functional, visually optimized web experiences while adapting to specific client tools and requirements.
