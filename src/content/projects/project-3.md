## Project Overview

Reaceiplas is an eco-friendly company that transforms plastic waste into plastic wood. Based on a Figma design created by my sister Karina VÃ¡squez (a talented designer and content creator), I was responsible for developing the website, including SEO optimization, form implementation, and responsive design.

## Key Responsibilities

- Translated Figma designs into a fully functional website
- Implemented responsive design for optimal viewing across devices
- Integrated and optimized web forms
- Conducted SEO optimization to improve site visibility

## Learning Experience

This project provided valuable experience working with Webflow, demonstrating its effectiveness for projects that prioritize design details over complex interactivity. It reinforced the importance of choosing the right tool for specific project requirements.

## Conclusion

The Reaceiplas website project showcases my ability to turn design concepts into functional, optimized web experiences while adapting to client-specific tools and requirements.
