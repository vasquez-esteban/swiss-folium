## Project Overview

This academic project involved developing the backend for an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. The API connects a local database and exposes GET and POST methods for managing patient information, risk factors, and clinical problems.

## Key Features

- RESTful API built with FastAPI
- Database integration using SQLAlchemy
- CRUD operations for patient data, risk factors, and clinical problems
- Adherence to healthcare industry best practices

## Development Process

1. Requirements elicitation through collaboration with a healthcare professional
2. Implementation of software development methodologies:
   - Use Case analysis
   - Entity-Relationship Modeling
   - Pre-conceptual Schemas
3. API development using FastAPI
4. Database design and integration with SQLAlchemy
5. Testing and validation of API endpoints

## Technical Challenges

- Ensuring data privacy and security in healthcare applications
- Designing a flexible database schema to accommodate various health record types
- Optimizing API performance for potential high-volume data operations

## Learning Experience

This project provided valuable insights into:

- Healthcare IT systems and their specific requirements
- Practical application of software development methodologies
- Building scalable and secure APIs for sensitive data
- Collaboration with domain experts (healthcare professionals)

## Conclusion

The API HCE project demonstrates my ability to develop backend systems for specialized industries, adhering to best practices and regulatory requirements. It showcases my skills in API development, database design, and applying theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world scenarios.
